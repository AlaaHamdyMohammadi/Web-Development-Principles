PSEUDO CLASSES: 

CSS pseudo-classes are keywords that are added to selectors to specify a special state of the selected elements. Here are some common types of pseudo-classes in CSS:

1. Structural Pseudo-Classes
:first-child: Targets the first child element within its parent.
:last-child: Targets the last child element within its parent.
:nth-child(n): Targets the nth child of its parent (e.g., :nth-child(2) for the second child).
:nth-last-child(n): Targets the nth child from the end of its parent.
:nth-of-type(n): Targets the nth child of its type within its parent.
:nth-last-of-type(n): Targets the nth child of its type from the end within its parent.
:only-child: Targets an element if it is the only child of its parent.
:empty: Targets an element if it has no children (including text nodes).

2. Form and Input Pseudo-Classes
:focus: Targets an element (like an input) when it has focus.
:hover: Targets an element when the user hovers over it with a cursor.
:active: Targets an element when it is being activated (e.g., a button being clicked).
:disabled: Targets disabled form elements.
:enabled: Targets enabled form elements.
:checked: Targets checkboxes or radio buttons that are checked.
:required: Targets form elements that are required.
:optional: Targets form elements that are not required.
:valid: Targets form elements with valid input data.
:invalid: Targets form elements with invalid input data.
:in-range: Targets input elements whose value is within a specified range.
:out-of-range: Targets input elements whose value is outside a specified range.

3. Interactive Pseudo-Classes
:link: Targets links that have not been visited.
:visited: Targets links that have already been visited.
:focus-within: Targets an element if it or any of its descendants have focus.

4. Pseudo-Classes for Dynamic States
:not(selector): Targets elements that do not match the given selector.
:is(selector): Targets elements that match any of a list of selectors (simplifies complex selectors).
:where(selector): Similar to :is(), but with no specificity (useful for styling without specificity issues).
:nth-last-child(n): Targets elements based on their position relative to their siblings (counting from the end).

5. Other Pseudo-Classes
:root: Targets the root element of the document (typically <html>).
:lang(language): Targets elements based on their language attribute.
:target: Targets an element that matches the current URL fragment (used in page navigation with anchors).
